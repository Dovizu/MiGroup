### Enjoy your chat time with your buddies, natively.
MiGroup is a lightweight OS X GroupMe client that supports basic features such as sending/receiving messages, group profile and member avatars, and offline viewing. In addition, MiGroup takes advantage of OS X 10.9's new "quick reply" notification feature to provide native message notifications and allow you to reply without ever leaving your working window.

### Notable Technologies
Thanks to Cocoa's powerful frameworks, and several great 3rd-party tools, MiGroup's development was delightful. The following technologies are used in this project:
* Cocoa Bindings (and KVO)
* Core Data (with [Magical Record](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord))
* [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)
* [FayeObjC](https://github.com/pcrawfor/FayeObjC) Socket Client
In addition, [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) greatly simplified dependency management.
A personal Thank You goes to the developers behind these amazing frameworks/tools!
